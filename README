Partial port of u-boot 2010.03 for Keil MCB1800.

Works
- Boot from spifi
- 16MB SDRAM
- UART with TX=PF_10, RX=PF_11
  (solder a USB to UART cable to those pins on the board, also connect the ground)
- Loading linux

Doesn't work
- Boot from NOR-flash (untested, but might work)
- Ethernet
- UART via serial port

Why do these things not work?
- NXP claims booting from spifi is faster than NOR-flash.
- Ethernet is not required for a bootloader, just use a JTAG debugger to write data to spifi.
  (Linux uses a different ethernet driver)
- UART0 via serial port has a big disadvantage; It cannot be used in combination with EMC.
  (soldering 3 pins to a cable is not a big deal, anyone can do that)


This port is based on the Emcraft Systems U-boot:
